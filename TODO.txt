Ideas and roadmap
-----------------
[x] Add #systemProperties variable

[ ] ELK adds an automatic correlation to MDC using agent instrumentation:
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/log-correlation.html.
    Adds these MDC parameters are automÃ¡tically added:
        - transaction.id
        - trace.id
        - error.id
    How to convert Java logs to ELK format: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs-logging/java/1.x/setup.html

[x] Access to private fields in local bean?

[ ] Add support for jboss-log-manager?

[ ] Use Agent or Annotation Processor instead of AOP?

[ ] Copy MDC state to another MDC context.
    [ ] Add support for Spring @Async annotation

[x] Parent-child parameters overwrite: when the child MDC is closed restore parent's params values that were overwritten by child MDC

[ ] In addition to try-with-resources add lambdas-based methods to MDC interface that open new MDC and run the task specified as lambda.

[ ] Document all public API

[ ] How to maintain method arguments' names after compilation (debug information)
    - remove @MDCParam.include

[ ] Class MDC: add lambda-based MDC definitions:
    MDC.with()
        .param("param1", "value1")
        .param("param2", "value2")
        .run(() -> {
            ...
        });
    MDC.runWith(() -> {
        ...
    })
